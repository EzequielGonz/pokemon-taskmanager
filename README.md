<h1>Pokemon TaskManager</h1>
<p style{
  font="bold"}>This personal project was created with the goal of improving my skills as a web developer, allowing me to experiment with and deepen my understanding of key technologies like HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout the process, I’ve integrated the Pokémon API, adding a dynamic and fun component to the interface, allowing users to interact with real-time data.

The main focus of this project is to create a useful and functional tool for users in their daily lives. I’ve implemented features that not only enhance the interactive experience but also provide practical value, such as the ability to look up information, manage simple tasks, or explore content efficiently.

Additionally, this project has allowed me to work on responsive interface design, ensuring that the user experience is seamless across both mobile devices and desktop screens. I’ve applied modular design principles with Tailwind CSS, helping me maintain clean and scalable code, which makes future updates easier.

I’ve also explored concepts of performance optimization and web accessibility, ensuring that the application is fast, inclusive, and easy to navigate for all users, regardless of their technical skills.

This is just the beginning of my exploration in the world of web development, and this project represents a platform for continuous learning, facing new challenges, and constant improvement.</p>
